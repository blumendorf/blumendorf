# Hi, I'm Marco Blumendorf 👋

### Director of Software Engineering — AI-native engineer with a PhD

🇩🇪 Based near Berlin, Germany · Working at the intersection of AI and publishing

### 👨‍💻 What I do

I spent a decade at TU Berlin researching adaptive UIs and distributed AI. Now I lead engineering teams, rethinking how we build software alongside AI.

- I lead engineering at **CHAPTR** (Holtzbrinck Publishing Group), building AI-powered products for the publishing industry
- I care deeply about **developer experience**, codebases AI can reason about, and teams that grow with their tools
- I believe AI in software development is the next great abstraction layer — and I'm building for that future every day

### 🚀 Current work

- **Director of Software Engineering — [CHAPTR](https://chaptr.ai)**
  Building [reedy.ai](https://reedy.ai) — AI-powered metadata optimization for publishers.
  Improving discoverability, making large book catalogs semantically searchable, and optimizing for platforms like Amazon.
  Focus: developer experience, AI-compatible codebase architecture, bridging product and engineering.

- **Startup Mentor & Advisor**
  Helping early-stage founders make sound technical decisions — from architecture and team setup to AI strategy.
  Drawing on 15+ years of building, scaling, and sometimes breaking things at startups.

### 🏆 Selected achievements

- **PhD in Distributed Artificial Intelligence** — TU Berlin's DAI-Labor, researching adaptive UIs across devices and modalities (voice, touch, gestures, smart environments) — what we'd now call generative UI
- **Advised 13 PhD students** during my time leading the Human-Computer Interaction research group
- **Scaled a smart home engineering team from 2 to 18 engineers** at yetu AG
- **CTO at smartB Energy Management** — raised funding and built an IoT platform for commercial energy management
- **CTO & Advisor** for multiple Berlin-based startups in sustainability and IoT
- **Traveled the world for 2 years** after completing my PhD
- **Left Berlin** for Brandenburg, raising chickens and kids, growing vegetables, building a home.

### 🧠 What I think about

I see AI as the latest level of abstraction in software:

> Punch cards → Assembler → Higher-level languages → Libraries & open source → **Generative AI** ← we are here

I build for codebases AI can reason about: simple folder structures, documentation about the *why* not just the *what*, established best practices, and tests as the ultimate lifeline.

I sometimes write and think about:
- How AI is changing engineering workflows
- Building developer experience that scales
- Greenfield projects and when to start fresh
- The publishing industry meets AI

*(Choice of tools depends on constraints — I don't believe in fixed stacks.)*

### 🔬 The Lab

I maintain a collection of browser-based AI experiments exploring local LLMs running entirely in the browser via WebGPU. Check them out at [blumendorf.info/lab](https://blumendorf.info/lab).
